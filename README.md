<h1 align="center" id="title">CATALYZING SUSTAINABLE HEALTHCARE: GEOSPATIAL ZONATION AND ROUTE STREAMLINING FOR MEDICAL WASTE MANAGEMENT</h1>

<p id="description">This project presents an optimized system for hospital waste collection using zone-based path optimization. By leveraging the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) and dynamic programming the system efficiently manages waste collection routes reducing travel time fuel consumption and operational costs. The project is designed to handle scalability and adapt to changes in hospital locations and waste production rates.</p>

<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   Geographical Data Integration: The system integrates geographical data including hospital locations and waste production rates to plan precise routes.
*   Zone Creation: The service area is divided into zones based on hospital spatial distribution and vehicle weight capacity optimizing routes within each zone.
*   TSP Algorithm: The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) algorithm is applied within each zone to determine the shortest possible routes for waste collection.
*   Resource Allocation: The project focuses on efficient resource distribution and minimizing environmental impact by reducing travel distances and fuel consumption.
*   Scalability: The system is designed for future scalability allowing for additional optimizations and adjustments as needed.

<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps:</h2>

<p>1. Clone the repository</p>

<p>2. Install the required libraries</p>

<p>3. Prepare the data by placing geographical information and waste production rates in the code data.</p>

<p>4. Run the python code to get the geographical coordinates of the hospital locations.</p>

<p>5. Run the C++ code to get the shortest path between the cities for waste collection in most optimized routes.</p>
